            <p class="lead">Version Control is a tool used by coders to have all of their data stored in one main repository.  These repositories can be based off of a web server (called remote repositories), or locally on a single workstation (called local repositories).  These repositories will save data that you add to it in an organized manner.  Using version control in this way will allow teams to design websites without having to save dozens of files on their own computer, under different names in order to be able to go back to old files, due to a mistake made in the future.  Version control allows teams to collaborate while working on a project together, without stepping on each other's toes when an individual wants to make a change.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Version Control System is a great tool to use for developing websites, especially if more than one person may be working on that project.  A VCS has will save the history of updates to a file in one central location.  For example- if you are working in a group of three people, who all work from different locations, using a version control system may be the safest way to work on a project.  There are countless different advantages to using a VCS, some of the most important being that files can't be overwritten, at any time you can revert back to your old files, and you will have a detailed history of who worked on a specific file; as well as when that person made changes to that file.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository is a repository that is held on a server.  This server can be accessed by people who are working on the same project from different locations.  This makes working from home, or other locations easier than ever by eliminating the worry of having your files overwritten.  Using a remote repository has countless advantages.  For example; if your group is creating a website, but not everyone is in the same location on a specific day, you can save your work to a remote repository in order to work on it from home.  While all of the members work on it from different computers - each copy of their work can be saved as it's own file.  This is very useful; if one member does work on that project and the rest of the group does not agree with their changes, the old file is easily retrievable on the repository.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is a repository that is held on a single computer.  Unlike the previous "remote repository"; this repository can only be accessed from one single location.  There are many advantages to this as well, many are the same as before.  Your work is always saved in one single location, without being overwritten.  Multiple people can still work on a project together while making changes to a previous file, while always being able to go back to the original file.  Having your work saved on one computer makes everything extremely secure, limiting access to those in the same location.  While this may be a pro - keeping your data secure, this also limits access to those who may need it.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a free, open source, version control system.  Many major companies use GIT, including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and many more.  GIT is a distributed software - this means that if you are working on a project; you will have all of the files from the repository stored locally on your own computer.  This benefits you if you do not have an internet connection.  Git uses many different commands; some of the most basic, but necessary commands are "add", "commit", and "push".  The "Add" command will add all of the current files and folders to the "staging area" of GIT.  After adding the files to the staging area, you will then use the "commit" command, you will commit changes to the local repository. Finally, the "push" command, will add the final files as a backup to the remote repository.</p>
